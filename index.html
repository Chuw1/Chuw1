                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I will join the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University as an Instructional Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. My research primarily focuses on machine learning, computer vision, and medical image processing. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Houston in 2021, where my work concentrated on Computational Methods for MRI-Guided and Powered Ferric Applicators: Modeling and Image Processing.</p>
                    <p>Before my appointment at Texas A&M, I served as a visiting professor at the University of Houston-Victoria.</p>

                    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I have a passion for teaching because it allows me to effectively transmit knowledge to future generations. I take great care in planning my classes and focus on condensing key topics that will be beneficial for students in the future. Teaching computer science, particularly programming-related courses, presents challenges as expressing fundamental coding logic and algorithms through a limited number of examples can be difficult. Nevertheless, the fulfillment I experience when witnessing my students successfully create impressive programs is truly rewarding.</p>
                    <p>I believe in fostering a collaborative and inclusive learning environment where students are encouraged to think critically and apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios. My teaching approach emphasizes hands-on experience, project-based learning, and the integration of current industry practices into the curriculum.</p>
